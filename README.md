Droid Defense
Abhinav is enthusiastic about game development. He wants to make a game where humanity fights against deadly automated Robots, but he is new to web development and is confused about how to proceed with the idea. Can you help him develop the game?

Game Logic
The Bots attack the player and the base. The player can move left and right and shoot the bots before they destroy the player's base. The game ends if

the player dies

the home base gets destroyed



Player protects the home base by shooting enemy bots

Normal Mode
Add bots that fall from the top and damage the player and the base
Make the player move left and right and be able to shoot in all directions
The player should shoot the bots to avoid damage to the base and the player
Add a suitable health and scoring system.
Hacker Mode
Add bots that can shoot, similar to the player
Make the player movable in all directions
Add powerups for the player
Implement general game features (leaderboard, sound, etc.)
Hacker++ Mode
Enemy Bots can spawn and attack from all directions

Player's base also has a turret that can shoot bots within a proximity

Enemies can shoot a homing missile that targets the player and the base

Add a Boss bot which has more health and does more damage



Player faces off against the Boss

NOTE: Normal mode is necessary to complete the task. Hacker and Hacker++ modes are highly encouraged
